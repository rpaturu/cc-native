# Phase 2 Synthesis Ruleset v1
# Deterministic rules for deriving AccountPostureState from signals and lifecycle state

# Rules are evaluated in priority order (lower priority number = evaluated first)
# First matching rule wins (deterministic, order-stable)

evaluation:
  # Rule evaluation is deterministic and order-stable
  # Rules are evaluated in priority order (1-99, lower = first)
  # First matching rule wins
  # All conditions must match for a rule to apply
  
  # Condition operators:
  # - equals: Exact match
  # - greater_than: Numeric comparison
  # - less_than: Numeric comparison
  # - in: Array membership
  # - exists: Property exists
  # - not_exists: Property does not exist
  
  # Signal property access:
  # - signal.data.{property_name} for signal data properties
  # - signal.metadata.{property_name} for signal metadata
  
  # Unknown TTL semantics:
  # - introduced_at: ISO timestamp when unknown was introduced
  # - expires_at: ISO timestamp when unknown expires (null = never)
  # - review_after: ISO timestamp when unknown should be reviewed (alternative to expires_at)
  
  # Posture state meanings:
  # - OK: Healthy, stable, no action needed
  # - WATCH: Requires attention, monitor closely
  # - AT_RISK: Risk factors present, intervention may be needed
  # - EXPAND: Opportunity for growth/expansion
  # - DORMANT: Inactive, no current engagement
  
  # Momentum meanings:
  # - UP: Positive trajectory
  # - FLAT: Stable, no change
  # - DOWN: Negative trajectory
