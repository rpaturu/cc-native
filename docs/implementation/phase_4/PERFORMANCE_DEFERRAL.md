# Phase 4 — Performance Measurement Deferral (4.5A)

If load testing is not done before Phase 4 sign-off, performance must be **explicitly deferred** to 4.5B with rationale and ticket. This doc is the placeholder for that deferral.

**See:** `PHASE_4_5_CODE_LEVEL_PLAN.md` §5 and §8 (DoD item 6).

## Deferral (fill if not measuring in 4.5A)

- **Status:** [x] Performance measurement deferred to 4.5B
- **Rationale:** No load testing in 4.5A scope. E2E script validates one deterministic path; formal SLOs (p95 latency, concurrent executions, retry rate) to be defined and measured in 4.5B.
- **Ticket:** Backlog — "Phase 4.5B: Define and measure Phase 4 execution SLOs (latency, concurrency, error rate)."

If you **do** measure and meet targets in §5, document results in PHASE_4_5_CODE_LEVEL_PLAN.md §5 (replace placeholders X, N, Y, Z) and do not use this deferral.
