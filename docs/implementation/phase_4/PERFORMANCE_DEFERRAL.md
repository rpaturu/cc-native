# Phase 4 — Performance Measurement Deferral (4.5A)

If load testing is not done before Phase 4 sign-off, performance must be **explicitly deferred** to 4.5B with rationale and ticket. This doc is the placeholder for that deferral.

**See:** `PHASE_4_5_CODE_LEVEL_PLAN.md` §5 and §8 (DoD item 6).

---

## Deferral (fill if not measuring in 4.5A)

- **Status:** [ ] Performance measurement deferred to 4.5B
- **Rationale:** _e.g. “No load testing in 4.5A scope; SLOs to be defined in 4.5B.”_
- **Ticket:** _e.g. backlog ticket ID or link_

If you **do** measure and meet targets in §5, document results in PHASE_4_5_CODE_LEVEL_PLAN.md §5 (replace placeholders X, N, Y, Z) and do not use this deferral.
