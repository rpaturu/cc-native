Below is a **sales–deal-lifecycle action map** written explicitly for an **AI-native Decision Layer**.
This is **not** a feature list. It’s a **set of action classes the system should own, drive, and escalate** across the lifecycle.

You can use this as:

* product scope
* investor narrative
* roadmap guardrails (what autonomy looks like in sales)

# AI-Native Sales Actions Across the Deal Lifecycle

## Framing (important for investors)

The system does **not** “run deals.”
It **drives the *right actions* at the *right moments*** across the lifecycle, with humans supervising where judgment or human touch is required.

Each section below answers:

* *What decisions does the system make?*
* *What actions does it drive?*
* *Where does the human step in?*

---

## 1. Targeting & Account Activation (Pre-Opportunity)

### AI-Native Decisions

* Is this account worth attention *now*?
* What signal suggests activation?
* Which persona should we engage first?

### Actions the system drives

* Identify accounts transitioning from cold → warm
* Propose **account activation actions**:

  * draft initial outreach
  * suggest intro paths (champion, adjacent team)
  * surface relevant trigger (hiring, news, usage pattern if customer)
* Recommend *not acting* when signals are weak (this matters)

### Human role

* Approve outreach tone/angle
* Choose which accounts to pursue

> **Value:** Focus moves from “coverage” to “signal-driven activation.”

---

## 2. Discovery & Qualification

### AI-Native Decisions

* Is this opportunity real or exploratory?
* Are we missing decision-critical stakeholders?
* Is discovery stalling?

### Actions the system drives

* Generate **discovery prep briefs**:

  * known pain points
  * hypotheses to test
  * questions mapped to persona
* Flag missing buying group roles
* Propose **re-engagement actions** when discovery stalls:

  * follow-up questions
  * reframing message
* Recommend qualification exit if signals don’t support pursuit

### Human role

* Validate hypotheses
* Choose whether to continue or disengage

> **Value:** Discovery quality becomes systematic, not rep-dependent.

---

## 3. Solution Mapping & Value Articulation

### AI-Native Decisions

* Is the solution aligned to expressed needs?
* Are value claims grounded in evidence?
* Are we talking to the right level?

### Actions the system drives

* Generate **persona-specific value narratives**
* Map product capabilities to stated pains
* Propose supporting proof points:

  * usage examples
  * case snippets
* Identify when value articulation is mismatched to persona

### Human role

* Adjust messaging nuance
* Decide escalation path (e.g., exec alignment)

> **Value:** Messaging consistency improves while remaining customizable.

---

## 4. Stakeholder Expansion & Buying Group Completion

### AI-Native Decisions

* Is the buying group complete?
* Where is influence concentrated?
* Which roles represent risk?

### Actions the system drives

* Identify **missing stakeholders** (security, finance, legal, ops)
* Propose outreach sequences *per role*
* Flag single-threaded risk
* Recommend internal alignment actions (e.g., bring exec sponsor)

### Human role

* Approve stakeholder engagement
* Handle sensitive outreach

> **Value:** Single-threaded deals are surfaced early, not after loss.

---

## 5. Deal Progression & Momentum Management

### AI-Native Decisions

* Is the deal progressing at a healthy pace?
* Are dates slipping meaningfully?
* Is buyer engagement weakening?

### Actions the system drives

* Detect **deal drift**
* Propose momentum-restoring actions:

  * schedule next milestone
  * send recap or alignment note
  * escalate internally
* Recommend *pausing* when buyer intent is low

### Human role

* Decide escalation vs patience
* Handle buyer conversations

> **Value:** Momentum is managed proactively, not reactively.

---

## 6. Objection Handling & Risk Mitigation

### AI-Native Decisions

* What objections are emerging?
* Are risks technical, commercial, or organizational?
* Is risk rising fast enough to warrant escalation?

### Actions the system drives

* Surface **objection themes** from notes, emails, calls
* Generate objection-specific talk tracks
* Propose mitigation actions:

  * internal alignment
  * customer workshop
  * revised proposal framing
* Escalate when risk crosses threshold

### Human role

* Choose mitigation strategy
* Lead sensitive conversations

> **Value:** Objection response becomes faster and more consistent.

---

## 7. Commercial Alignment & Close Readiness

### AI-Native Decisions

* Is this deal actually close-ready?
* Are commercial blockers unresolved?
* Is the close date credible?

### Actions the system drives

* Close-readiness assessment
* Highlight gaps:

  * legal
  * procurement
  * security
* Propose **close plan** actions:

  * stakeholder sync
  * timeline confirmation
  * internal approvals
* Recommend pushing close date when evidence doesn’t support it

### Human role

* Negotiate terms
* Final decision authority

> **Value:** Forecast accuracy improves without policing reps.

---

## 8. Renewal & Expansion (Customer Lifecycle)

### AI-Native Decisions

* Is the account healthy?
* Is renewal risk emerging?
* Is expansion timing right?

### Actions the system drives

* Early renewal risk detection (usage, support, engagement)
* Generate **renewal prep briefs**
* Propose expansion discovery actions when health is strong
* Recommend *not* pushing expansion when risk exists

### Human role

* Lead renewal conversation
* Shape expansion strategy

> **Value:** Renewals stop being last-minute fire drills.

---

## 9. Post-Deal Learning & Memory

### AI-Native Decisions

* What should be remembered?
* What actions correlated with success or failure?
* What patterns should influence future deals?

### Actions the system drives

* Propose memory updates:

  * what worked
  * what failed
* Adjust action ranking and confidence thresholds
* Improve future recommendations

### Human role

* Approve sensitive memory writes
* Provide outcome validation

> **Value:** The system compounds experience across the org.

## What Makes This AI-Native (investor framing)

Traditional tools:

* react to user input
* automate steps
* leave decisions to humans

Your system:

* **decides when to act**
* **decides what action matters**
* **decides when to involve a human**
* **learns from outcomes**

---

## One-sentence investor summary

> **Across the entire deal lifecycle, our system doesn’t automate tasks — it drives the right actions at the right moments, with humans supervising only where judgment or customer interaction is required.**
